# Nordlys

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/nordlys/badge/?version=latest)](https://nordlys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Entities (such as people, organizations, or products) are meaningful units for organizing information and can provide direct answers to many search queries.  Nordlys is a toolkit for entity-oriented and semantic search. 


## Functionality

Nordlys currently supports four entity-oriented tasks, which are core components in semantic search:

  * Entity cataloging
  * Entity retrieval
  * Entity linking in queries
  * Target type identification


## Features

  * General-purpose information retrieval and machine learning components at its core
  * Implementations of various methods for the above entity-oriented search tasks (with more on their way)
  * Based on the DBpedia knowledge base (extendable to other knowledge bases)
  * Can used as a black box through a [RESTful API](http://api.nordlys.cc/)
  * Can be reached via a [graphical web user interface](http://gui.nordlys.cc/)
  * Can be deployed on a local server and used as a Python package or as a command line tool
  * Highly modular and [well documented](http://nordlys.readthedocs.io/) code, based on a 3-tier architecture
  * Open source project that is actively being developed


## Disclaimer

Nordlys is not (yet) a mature production-level system, but rather a research prototype (as can be seen from the current version number, which is v0.2).  We welcome contributions on all levels (pull requests, suggestions for improvements, feature requests, etc.).
